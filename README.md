**Title:** Daisyworld: A simple climate-biosphere feedback model

**Abstract:**
<p align="justify">
In this project we investigate the interactions between biota and environment and the properties of this coupled system through the Daisyworld model. Daisyworld is an imaginary planet similar to Earth with a simple biosphere of black and white daisies and the environment represented by a single climate variable, the temperature. In this study we computed two models: a 1D model and a latitude dependent model using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the differential equations explaining our models. Moreover we investigated different parametetrizations of the models: simple greenhouse effect, heat transport and orbital forcings. We show that the interactions between the variables of the system effectively regulate the planetary temperature by keeping it constant, even for a large range of solar luminosity
values and different model parametrizations.
